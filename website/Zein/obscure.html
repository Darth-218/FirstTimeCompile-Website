    <h2>Array-Based Languages</h2>
    <h3>APL, BQN, J, Uiua...</h3>
    <p>
      Array languages are very different from other styles of programming. In
      these, the main data type is the <em>array</em> (basically a type of
      list) and the idea of the program is that the instructions you specify
      will get executed on the entire array at the same time. This makes them
      very fast and well suited for problems where you have a big list of
      things that you want to do things to, including if you have a big matrix
      (which could be higher than 2-dimensional!). Most popular array languages
      are unicode-based, which means that they use glyphs or symbols instead of
      words. For example, here is a bit of Uiua code that defines a function
      that takes a list of two numbers and returns their hypotnuse (i.e. it
      returns the squareroot of the sum of their squares):
    </p>

    <code class="block">
      Hypot ← ⍜⍘√/+
    </code>

    <p>
      What this code basically does is that it <em>reduces</em> the list by
      summing it after getting the "inverse-squareroot" (i.e. the sqaure) of
      each one, then getting the "inverse inverse-squareroot" (i.e. the
      squareroot) of the result.
    </p>

    <p>
      A problem that demonstrates their ability over arrays and matrices more
      is this program (also in Uiua) that checks if a matrix is an "x-matrix"
      or not; an x-matrix is a matrix that has 0s everywhere except for its
      diagonals.
    </p>

    <code class="block">
      CheckMatrix ← ≍↧1∶↥⇌.⊞=.⇡⧻.
    </code>

    <p>
      It generates an identity matrix, copies it and reverses the copy, adding
      the two matrices together (this creates an x-matrix with 1s on the
      diagonals), then reduces the original matrix so that all its elements are
      1s, then checks to see if the two matrices are the same.
    </p>

    <h2>Esoteric Languages</h2>
    <h3>Brainf*ck, Piet, Shakespeare, Chef...</h3>
    <p>
      You might be wondering: “Why would there be a programming language called
      <em>Brainf*ck</em>”? Well, here's a simple Brainf*ck program that prints
      “Hello, world!” on the screen:
    </p>

    <code class="block">
++++++++[>++++[>++>+++>+++>+<<<<-]>+>+>->>+[<]<-]>>.>---.+++++++..+++.>>.<-.<.+++.------.--------.>>+.>++.
    </code>

    <p>
      You now know why the language is called Brainf*ck.
    </p>

    <p>
      Esoteric programming languages are languages which were not created with
      the purpose of being used to write real programs, rather they were
      created to demonstrate an idea, as an exercise for the person making them
      or just for fun. Piet, for example, is meant to be a language that looks
      like abstract art. Here is a piet program that prints the word “Piet”:
    </p>

    <center>
    <img src="Piet_Program.gif"
      alt="A colourful picture that looks like abstract art.">
    </center>

    <p>
      Similarly, Chef code is meant to resemble a recipe, and Shakespeare code
      looks like the script for a play.
