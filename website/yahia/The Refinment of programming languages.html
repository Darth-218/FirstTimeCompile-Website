                The increased use of <i class="italicname">high-level</i> languages introfuced a requirement for <i class="italicname">low-level</i> languages, 
                to a varying degree these languages provide facilities between <i class="assembly">assembly</i> languages and <i class="italicname">high-level</i> languages.
                they can be used to perform tasks that require direct access to the hardware and still provide higher-level control and error-checking.

                <h3> APL </h3>

                    <p>
                        APL intoduced <i>array programming</i>, that allows the application to operate on an entire set of values at once, 
                        and influenced <i>functional programming</i>.
                    </p>

                <h3> Simula </h3>

                    <p>
                        In the 1960s, Simula was the first language designed to support <i>object-oriented</i> programming, followed later in the mid 1970s by <i class="smalltalk">Smalltalk</i>, 
                        the first purely <i> object-oriented</i> language.
                    </p>

                <h3> Prolog </h3>

                    <p>
                        <i class="prolog">Prolog</i>, in 1972, was the first <i>logic programming</i> language, a program in a logic programming language is a set of sentences in logical 
                        form expresssing facts and rules about some problem domain.
                    </p>
                

            </ul>
            
            <p>
                Each of these languages has descendants, and most modern programming languages count at least one of them in their ancestry
