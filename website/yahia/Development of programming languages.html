                            Earlier computers, without the help of a stored program, were programmed
                            by modifying their circuitry. Programs were later written in machine
                            code, which is a set of instruction, in binary or decimal, the hardware
                            can excute directly. Those languages were later re-named to
                            <i class="italicname">First-generation</i> programming languages.

                            development, They were still closely tied to the instruction set
                            architecture of the specific computer,
                            <i class="italicname">Second generation</i> languages were intended to
                            make the program more readable by humans and relived the programmer of

                        written in the 1950s. An example is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plankalk%C3%BCl">Plankalkul</a> developed
                        for the German <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z3_(computer)">Z3</a> between 1943 and 1945. However not

                                        Proposed in 1949 by John Mauchly, Short code was one of the
                                        first <i class="italicname">high-level</i> languages ever
                                        developed for an electronic computer. Short code, unlike Machine
                                        code, represented mathematical statements in an understandable
                                        form. However, since the code could not be read directly by the
                                        hardware it made the excution process much slower than that of
                                        the machine code

                                            The first code and compiler were developed for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_Mark_1">Mark 1</a> at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Manchester">University of Manchester</a> in 1952
