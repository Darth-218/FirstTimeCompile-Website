      minimal compilation. this makes Go good for creating tools such as access
      servers like Teleport.Microservices. Go language's fast startup time, low
      runtime overhead and ability to run without a VM make it quite popular
      for writing microservices.

      Java is an object oriented language so it makes the "data members" and
      data manipulation together. Binding the data makes the program more
      secure and also capable of working with different resources and
