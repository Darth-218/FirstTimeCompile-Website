      Programming languages have spread and multiplied like a virus since their
      <a href="developement.html">inception</a> in the previous century, and
      split off into many different <a href="types.html">types</a> (including
      some that not many <a href="obscure.html">have heard of</a>, and fewer
      would want to use) like the branches of a tree. With their spread—and the
      spread of those who use them—came a lot of different <a
        href="terms.html">ways to refer</a> to concepts that didn't exist yet.
