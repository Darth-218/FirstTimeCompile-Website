    Algrothims and flowcharts are ways of preparing for writing code.
    It helps in mapping out the coding experince and coordinating everything under one umberlla.
    While algrothims and flowcharts are pretty much a means to the same end, they differ in their illustration process, algrothims being more text based written in ordered lines, flowcharts are more on the graphical side.
    Their usage depends on the users preferences and the easier way to preparing the code.     In depth comprasion between Algrothims and flowcharts:

        <td>- A flowchart is a graphical representation of the steps a program takes to process data. In this, we can use several geometric patterns
          to ilustrate the numerous actions the program carries out.</td>

          we can say that it is a set of instructions for solving a well-defined computational problem.</td></tr>
