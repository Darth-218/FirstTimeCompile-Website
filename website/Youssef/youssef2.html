    <h3>Go</h3>

    <p>
      Go programs launch quickly and can be easily redistributed because of its
      minimal compilation. this makes Go good for creating tools such as access
      servers like Teleport.Microservices. Go language's fast startup time, low
      runtime overhead and ability to run without a VM make it quite popular
      for writing microservices.

    <h3>Java</h3>

    <p>
      Java is an <a href="../Zein/types.html">object oriented</a> language so
      it makes the "data members" and data manipulation together. Binding the
      data makes the program more secure and also capable of working with
      different resources and platforms.
