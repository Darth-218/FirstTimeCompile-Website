    <h3>
      Ahmed Mohamed Afifi
    </h3>

    <h4 class="ID">ID: 231000402</h4>

    <p>
      Meet the former leader of the team while we were making the best
      presentation the university has ever seen (and will ever see, unless we
      decide to make another one in the future)! This guy has made his very own
      music streaming mobile application in dart, not to mention countless
      arduino projects in the microprocessor's modified C++; from an AC remote
      controllable from your laptop to hacking the Pentagon (one of these is
      true, not sure which one), this dude's got you covered.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Ahmed Mohamed Abd-Elmaboud
    </h3>

    <h4 class="ID">ID: 231000224</h4>

    <p>
      He's completely unbeatable in League of Legends and Elden Ring, and he's
      won a free ticket to <i>Sa’yet el Sāwi</i> by just being so damn awesome.
      Fun fact: he went to the same school as our very own Ahmed Mohamed Afifi!
    </p>

    <h3>
      Yahia Hany Gaber
    </h3>

    <h4 class="ID">ID: 231000412</h4>

    <p>
      Coming all the way from the most expensive city in (the Egyptian version
      of) Monopoly, el-Moqattam, our team leader has absolutely no fear. Either that
      or he's suicidal. I'm not sure which. What I <em>do</em> know, however,
      is that he's made multiple projects in Python before.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Youssef Mohamed Andil
    </h3>

    <h4 class="ID">ID: 231000562</h4>

    <p>
      Boasting the highest ID number in the team, our newest member has
      dominated many basketball games. You can often spot this fellow hanging
      around in his basketball vest and holding a ball, always ready to go for
      a game or two (or three). Needless to say, this member is certified
      <b>ballin'</b>.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Zein Hatem Hafez
    </h3>

    <h4 class="ID">ID: 231000057</h4>

    <p>
      It is never very hard to find this guy, all you have to do is look for
      someone with impeccable fashion sense and a great hat. From <i>Magic: the
        Gathering</i> to <i>YuGiOh!</i> to <i>Flesh and Blood</i> to any
      variant of <i>Hanafuda</i>, he'll dominate you in any card game you
      challenge him at. He's also proficient in many languages, including
      Python, C#, C++, Rust, Haskell, and Uiua; not to mention human languages.
    </p>

    <h2>Why ‘FirstTimeCompile’?</h2>
    <p>
      If you've ever written code in a compiled language, you know that every
      time you write a piece of code and try to run it the compiler will always
      have some complaint about the code you wrote, and won't let you run it
      unless you go fix all those <i>compile-time errors</i>. Thus, when you
      run <code>$ cc main.c</code>, <code>$ g++ main.cpp</code>, or <code>$
        cargo run</code> (or simply press F5 in VS Code) and find that your
      code <em>compiled first time</em> with no errors is the single greatest
      feeling you can get as a programmer.
