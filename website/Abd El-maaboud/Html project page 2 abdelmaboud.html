    <h2>1. API:</h2>

    <p class="paragraph">
      Application Programming Interface (API) is a set of rules, routines,and
      protocols to build software applications. APIs help in communication with
      third party programs or services, which can be used to build different
      software. Companies such as Facebook and Twitter actively use APIs to
      help developers gain easier access to their services.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Bug</h2>

    <p class="paragraph">
      A bug is a general term used to denote an unexpected error or defect in
      hardware or software, which causes it to malfunction. Even though bugs
      are often considered to be insignificant computer glitches, there have
      been instances where bugs have caused life-threatening conditions and led
      to major financial losses. This makes it imperative to invest in the
      process of finding bugs before programs are rolled out for their
      application. This process is known as testing.
    </p>

    <h2> 3. Conditionals:</h2>

    <p class="paragraph">
      Conditionals, conditional statements, and conditional expressions are
      features of programming language, which help the code make a choice and
      result in either TRUE or FALSE. These perform different actions depending
      on the need of the programmer, and multiple conditions can be combined
      into a single condition, as long as the final value of the condition is
      either TRUE or FALSE. Examples of conditional statements are ‘If’,
      ‘If-Else’, ‘While’ and ‘Else-If’.
    </p>

    <h2> 4. Data types:</h2>

    <p class="paragraph">
      A data type is the classification of a particular type of data. We as
      humans can understand the difference between a name and a number, but the
      computer cannot. The computer uses special internal codes to distinguish
      between different types of data it receives and processes. The most
      common data types include integer type which are numbers, a
      floating-point number data type which are decimal based numbers, Boolean
      values which are TRUE or FALSE and character data type which is
      alphabets.
