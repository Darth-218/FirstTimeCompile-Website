    <h3>Hand-Coded Machine Code...</h3>
    <p>
      The first computers did not have any interface aside from a couple LEDs,
      so it wouldn't have been possible to have a programming language in any
      sense. Instead, the binary machine code was coded <em>by hand</em> into
      the machine itself. The computer that flew man to the moon, for example,
      had it's code <em>woven</em> into the machine in the form of several
      wires braided together in a specific way to signify different data.

    <h3>Assembly</h3>
    <h4>Intel, ARM...</h4>
    <p>
      On more modern computers, instructions are not generally coded in machine
      code directly, but in something <em>very</em> slightly higher level:
      Assembly. There are several versions of assembly, as each processor works
      differently.
